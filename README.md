# Steam Review analysis for Recommendation prediction and genre prediction


## Introduction
As part of our CSE258 Course: Recommender System and Data Mining, we designed and programmed multiple traditional machine learning models to predict the genre of a game and whether the user is recommending it from its review on Steam. Experimented with different techniques such as Sentimental Analysis, TF-IDF, Linear Support Vector Classification, LogReg, Ridge Regression, and Multinomial Naive Bayes and compared their performances. Random Forest with Balanced data gave the highest accuracy of 90.53% for recommendation prediction, while TFIDF + Log Reg topped the charts with 92.567% accuracy for multi-class genre prediction.

## Dataset:
We have used the Steam Review analysis dataset available at Kaggle to perform the mentioned tasks.

## How to Run
It is straightforward to run. The [ipynb](https://github.com/JayJhaveri1906/Recommendation-and-Genre-Prediction/blob/main/CSE258_ass2.ipynb) is well documented, and we highly encourage you to glance over our [report](https://github.com/JayJhaveri1906/Recommendation-and-Genre-Prediction/blob/main/Steam_Project_Report.pdf). The report explains our journey of data exploration and visualization, in-turn explaining the reasons of our choice of models.
